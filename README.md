## Setup

* Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* Build the images: `make build`
* Make sure that the path where this code resided can be mounted as
  a volume with Docker.
* Run the tests on all images: `make test`
* Add awesome features!

The tests on Travis are only run directly on that VM. Make sure to run
the full test suite manually before every release.
